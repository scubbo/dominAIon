* Record Gamestates (in persistence) vectorized, rather than JSON
 * (prerequisite for the above) change RandomStrategy to accept Vectorized state
* Include "setup/universe" in persistence - a (hashed?) representation of the set of known cards&sitations that the game was run with.
 * This is necessary to ensure that RNN training only happens on similar cases
* Make cleanups that PyCharm recommends
