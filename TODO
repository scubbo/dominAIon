# TODO

* Include "setup/universe" in persistence - a (hashed?) representation of the set of known cards&sitations that the game was run with.
 * This is necessary to ensure that RNN training only happens on similar cases

# DONE

* Make cleanups that PyCharm recommends
* Record Gamestates (in persistence) vectorized, rather than JSON
 * (Look in the removed "interpreter" class)
 * (prerequisite for the above) change RandomStrategy to accept Vectorized state
